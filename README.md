# ðŸ§± Kubernetes â€“ Production Upgrade Notes

### ðŸ“Œ Purpose:

This guide outlines best practices and step-by-step procedures for safely upgrading Kubernetes clusters (specifically EKS) in a production environment.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Overview of Kubernetes Release Notes (v1.32 â†’ v1.33)

Before performing any upgrade, carefully review the official Kubernetes release notes to understand:

* **New features and enhancements**
* **Deprecated APIs** or removed components
* **Security patches**
* **Behavior changes** affecting workloads or controllers
* **Component version compatibility** (Kubelet, kube-proxy, etc.)

Refer to:

* [Kubernetes Changelog 1.33](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md)
* [Kubernetes Changelog 1.32](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.32.md)

---

## âœ… Prerequisites

1. **Cordon Nodes**

   * Prevent scheduling new pods on nodes.
   * Avoid application updates or deployments during upgrade.

2. **Review Release Notes**

   * Go through the 1.32 â†’ 1.33 change log thoroughly.
   * Identify any API deprecations, version mismatches, or breaking changes.

3. **Environment Upgrade Strategy**

   * Kubernetes upgrades on **EKS are irreversible**.
   * Always upgrade **lower environments (dev, QA)** first.
   * Wait at least **1 week** post-validation before upgrading **production**.

4. **Version Compatibility**

   * **Control Plane** and **Node Groups** must be on the **same Kubernetes version**.
   * Donâ€™t proceed until they match.

5. **Cluster Autoscaler Compatibility**

   * Ensure Cluster Autoscaler version supports the target Kubernetes version.

6. **IP Address Availability**

   * Ensure **at least 5 free IP addresses** are available in each subnet during the upgrade.

7. **Kubelet Version Match**

   * The `kubelet` on nodes must match the version of the control plane.

## ðŸ”„ Actual Upgrade Process

### 1. ðŸš€ Upgrade Control Plane (Approx. 30 mins)

* EKS-managed Kubernetes offers:

  * **High Availability**
  * **Disaster Recovery**
  * **Built-in Security**
  * **API Server Auto-Scaling**
* Control plane upgrade is automated and non-disruptive (but should still be tested beforehand).

### 2. ðŸ§± Upgrade Node Groups (1 hour+)

* Upgrade **Managed Node Groups** using **rolling updates**.
* This uses a **node-by-node rollout approach** to minimize disruption.

### 3. ðŸ”§ Upgrade Add-ons (Approx. 30 mins)

* Includes:

  * **CoreDNS**
  * **Kube-Proxy**
  * **VPC CNI plugin**
* Ensure each add-on version is compatible with the upgraded control plane.

---

## ðŸ§ª Post-Upgrade â€“ Testing

* Run **functional, regression, and integration tests**.
* Validate that:

  * Workloads are running smoothly.
  * No pod crashes, deployment failures, or network issues.
  * Monitoring and logging are intact.
