**What is Reloader?**
Reloader is a Kubernetes controller that automates the rollout of workloads (e.g., Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets) when associated Secrets or ConfigMaps are updated. It ensures applications use the latest configurations without manual intervention, addressing the Kubernetes limitation where pod restarts aren't triggered by Secret or ConfigMap changes.

**Why Use Reloader?**
- **Automation**: Eliminates manual workload restarts after config changes.
- **Security**: Ensures apps use up-to-date credentials or tokens.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple workload types (Deployments, StatefulSets, etc.).
- **CI/CD Integration**: Speeds up feedback loops in dynamic environments.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple annotation-based setup for automatic reloads.

**How It Works?**
1. **Monitoring**: Reloader watches Secrets and ConfigMaps (created manually, via GitOps, or tools like ExternalSecret).
2. **Detection**: When changes are detected, it triggers a rollout of associated workloads.
3. **Customization**: Annotations control reload behavior:
   - **Auto Reload**: `reloader.stakater.com/auto: "true"` reloads on any referenced Secret/ConfigMap change.
   - **Named Resource Reload**: Specify exact resources to monitor (e.g., `secret.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "my-secret"`).
   - **Targeted Reload**: Use `reloader.stakater.com/search` and `match` for precise control.
   - **Ignore Resources**: Skip specific ConfigMaps/Secrets with `reloader.stakater.com/ignore: "true"`.
   - **Pause Rollouts**: Pause reloads for a set period to avoid frequent restarts.
   - **Restart Strategy**: Choose between `rollout` (default) or `restart` to avoid GitOps drift.
4. **Alerting**: Sends notifications (e.g., Slack, Google Chat) on reload events.
5. **Installation**: Supports Helm, Kubernetes manifests, or Kustomize with customizable resource limits and runtime flags.

**Key Features**:
- Works with Kubernetes ≥ 1.19.
- Enterprise version with SLA support and certified images.
- Debugging via pprof profiling.
- Flexible reload strategies (`env-vars` or `annotations`).
- Namespace and resource filtering for targeted monitoring.

### Alternatives to Reloader

1. **Kustomize with Native Kubernetes**:
   - **What**: Use Kustomize to manage ConfigMaps/Secrets and trigger rollouts manually or via GitOps tools like ArgoCD or Flux.
   - **Why**: Native to Kubernetes, no external controller needed; suits GitOps workflows.
   - **How**: Update ConfigMaps/Secrets in a Git repository, and let GitOps tools apply changes and trigger rollouts.
   - **Pros**: No additional dependencies; aligns with GitOps.
   - **Cons**: Requires manual setup or GitOps tooling; less automation for dynamic updates.

2. **ArgoCD with ApplicationSet**:
   - **What**: ArgoCD’s ApplicationSet automates workload updates based on ConfigMap/Secret changes in Git.
   - **Why**: Ideal for GitOps environments; integrates with Kubernetes natively.
   - **How**: Define ApplicationSets to monitor config changes in Git and trigger rollouts.
   - **Pros**: Robust for GitOps; no extra controller needed.
   - **Cons**: Requires GitOps setup; less suited for non-GitOps workflows.

3. **Flux with Kustomize Controller**:
   - **What**: Flux watches Git repositories for ConfigMap/Secret changes and triggers workload updates.
   - **Why**: Lightweight GitOps solution with strong community support.
   - **How**: Configure Flux to sync ConfigMaps/Secrets from Git and apply changes to workloads.
   - **Pros**: GitOps-native; minimal overhead.
   - **Cons**: Limited to Git-based workflows; requires Git repository management.

4. **Sealed Secrets with Bitnami’s Controller**:
   - **What**: Bitnami’s Sealed Secrets encrypts Secrets and triggers workload updates when decrypted Secrets change.
   - **Why**: Enhances security for Secrets management; integrates with Kubernetes.
   - **How**: Use SealedSecrets controller to manage encrypted Secrets, with rollouts triggered on updates.
   - **Pros**: Strong security focus; Kubernetes-native.
   - **Cons**: Primarily for Secrets; less flexible for ConfigMaps.

5. **External Secrets Operator**:
   - **What**: Syncs secrets from external providers (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Vault) and triggers workload updates.
   - **Why**: Ideal for external secret management; supports dynamic updates.
   - **How**: Configure ExternalSecrets to sync secrets and use annotations or webhooks to trigger rollouts.
   - **Pros**: Integrates with external secret stores; automated sync.
   - **Cons**: Focused on secrets; requires additional setup for ConfigMaps.

6. **Custom Scripts with Kubectl**:
   - **What**: Use custom scripts or cron jobs to monitor ConfigMap/Secret changes and trigger `kubectl rollout restart`.
   - **Why**: Simple, no external tools needed; full control over logic.
   - **How**: Write scripts to watch resources via Kubernetes API and issue rollout commands.
   - **Pros**: Highly customizable; no additional dependencies.
   - **Cons**: Manual development and maintenance; error-prone.

**Recommendation**:
- For **GitOps environments**, use **ArgoCD** or **Flux** for seamless integration with Git-based workflows.
- For **Secret-heavy setups**, consider **Sealed Secrets** or **External Secrets Operator**.
- For **general automation** without GitOps, Reloader remains a strong choice due to its simplicity and flexibility.
- For **minimal setups**, custom scripts with `kubectl` work but require more maintenance.
